## Limitations

`PAKFILE`&`ENTITIES` lumps can't be bigger than the original

## ToDo

  - [ ] WASM - needs file action interops
  - [ ] Proper serialisation - right now all it does is replace data in-place and zero the rest
  - [ ] Nicer entity editor
  - [ ] Actually working Map View potentially possibly?
